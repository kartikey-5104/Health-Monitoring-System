# HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM

## Summary
The Health Monitoring System is a data-driven project designed to analyze health parameters for 10,000 patients. It leverages Apache Spark for scalable data processing, ensuring efficient health data management and insightful analytics. The system processes patient profiles, computes essential health statistics, and presents the findings in a structured format. Future enhancements include real-time monitoring and machine learning integration.
